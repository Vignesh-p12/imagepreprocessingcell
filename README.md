                  DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE  INTEGRATED
       CELL MORPHOLOGY ANALYSIS AND BLOOD CANCER CELL
  DETECTION USING GRAD-CAM AND 3 VISUALIZATION MODEL
I Have designed and implement a software based platform that can facilitate the acquistion and processing the 3D cell images to analyze the cell morphology using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques
Atfirst we have collected various stages of blood cancer cell detection through datasets with satges of begin,early,pre,post types of images it was acquired in 2d images and extracting features through the
convolutional neural networks model.py and created a web application using flask web app in app.py with upload type of images and compare the extracted features with normal sample of images and analyzing 
data integrating with cnn model,test and validate the platform in index.html and result.html by predicting the disease and atlast 3d visualization
Abstract For this project
    As the focus of this research leans more towards the development of an automated system that is intended for the classification of cell morphology based on deep learning technology, which is known as the 
    architecture of a  Convolutional Neural Network, features from a 2D cell image, which were acquired through confocal microscopy, are utilized for classification pertaining to different morphological categories.
    Focusing on image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model evaluation, this prototype shall therefore realize high accuracy and efficiency in cell morphology classification; possible applications include 
    biomedical research, disease diagnosis, and personalized medicine. In using several software components, it adopts a combination of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, image 
    preprocessing libraries like OpenCV and scikit-image, and classifier libraries such as scikit-learn. The prototype is tested and trained on a sample 2D cell image dataset; a smaller subset of images will 
    be used for validation and hyperparameter tuning. This should be powerful enough to revolutionize the area of cell morphology analysis. Through its power, it is possible to gain insight into how the cells
    behave and function.
